# 2D-Dodge-Game
The game is set within a 2D space where two player-controlled agents, represented by circles, 
navigate within a bordered environment. Two enemy entities also move within the space, attempting to
collide with the player agents. The objective is to maneuver the player-controlled agents and avoid 
collisions with the enemies to sustain as long as possible and achieve a high score. Once a collision 
between a player agent and an enemy occurs, the game ends, leading to a game over-screen 
displaying the final score.
